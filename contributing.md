# Contributing Guide

Please submit new PRs from a fork of the project.

## Local development

Install deps:

```shell
npm install
```

Begin the development server with:

```shell
npm run start
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

Edit files in `src` and see the browser automatically reload on file change.

## Areas requiring help

- `css` to be compatible with [`docsify-themable`](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable)
- themes? I am open to suggestions
